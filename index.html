        <i>How can you not love programming? </i>
        It makes everything easlier. Technology is the new oil and gas and it's
        climate friendly. You can collaborate with people from different part of
        the world.

        <i>Imagine building a website without design...Hmmm,</i> that sounds
        awful already.

      <p><b>This is why CSS is very important </b></p>
      <p>
        The design of the website should be done using CSS in other to attract
        your target customers. I understand the concept of box models and how
        CSS can be used to style images and text due to the stutern.

        <b>In CSS box model,</b> We have the Margin which is the outermost part
        of the model. <i>Inside the margin we have the border,</i> this is the
        line that outlines the content. The padding is the space between the
        border and content while the content is where the text is placed.
